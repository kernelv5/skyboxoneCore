It makes it easier for people to follow what is going on, we can't all follow all mailing lists and git logs and forums and so on. To start this up I went through information sources like the development mailing list, blogs, news and more and compiled an article about the whole month of April. If you all like it, I can start doing this weekly.<br><br>Now I can't follow everything either, of course, so it would be helpful if you, dear readers, could send what YOU know is going on to me! That would ensure I don't miss any cool things. Mail me or ping me over G+, twitter or somewhere else! Any suggestion is welcome.<br><br><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6zb46hU1SDs/U3PJZM54ooI/AAAAAAAAOow/8q_jOQY_VnI/s1600/mockups.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6zb46hU1SDs/U3PJZM54ooI/AAAAAAAAOow/8q_jOQY_VnI/s1600/mockups.png" height="400" width="386"></a></td></tr><tr><td>UI mockups of new features</td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>Development</h2>So, let's start with what happened in ownCloud development in April, separated by core, cloud and clients. Note that what is below is not guaranteed to end up in a release! We might re-design things, defer to a later release to give it more testing or change the feature otherwise...<br><br><h3>ownCloud core</h3><br><ul><li>Work is happening to refine the oC 7 public API.</li><li>Lots of work on LDAP improvements (much of that landed in 6.0.3, see <a href="https://blog.schiwon.me/ldap-owncloud-603-improved-performance-and-more">this blog</a>)</li><li>Some work is done for improving support for high dpi screens! See <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/8058">PR 1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/8065">PR 2</a> for details.</li><li>Progress on a tool for <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/6457">conversion of data between various databases</a></li><li>Some neat 'ajaxification' in the core, making way for:</li><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/7167">infinite scrolling for files app</a> got merged!</li><li><a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/8041">file sorting (by clicking column headers)</a> is under development, needs review and help...</li></ul><li>The new user management from <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/7151">this pull request</a> is almost ready to be merged!</li><li>There is a project going on to make the normal ownCloud UI <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/8159">more usable on mobile devices</a>. Help is of course very welcome as this is a lot of work!</li></ul><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tHuHOwSQfLw/U3PJYfMZ5_I/AAAAAAAAOoo/a87jQF-oSaA/s1600/mockup.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tHuHOwSQfLw/U3PJYfMZ5_I/AAAAAAAAOoo/a87jQF-oSaA/s1600/mockup.jpg" height="320" width="229"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Good old fashioned paper mockup</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>ownCloud apps</h3><br><ul><li><a href="http://github.com/owncloud/apps/pull/1769">work is going on</a> to improve the view on what happened on your ownCloud in the activity app</li><li>Infinite scrolling &amp; neater layout for pictures app are coming.</li><li>A much improved music app is coming, and a variety of features is under development, like <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/music/pull/233">new playlist functionality</a>.</li></ul><br><br><h3>ownCloud clients</h3><br><ul><li>The iOS saw work on multiple-downloads support. Not finished yet but a future version should include this. There was also work on the 'favorite files' feature.</li><li>The Android client got the <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/149">InstantUpload video branch</a> finally merged. This means that once released, the client can upload video instantly, either always or only when on wifi. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zerginator">zerginator</a> for doing the hard work!</li><li>The first beta for the 1.6 release of the desktop client came out and a bunch of bugs got fixed based on the feedback that came in. If you have not tried the new release, help us test it so we can make it even better. Read more about this upcoming release in <a href="https://daniel.molkentin.net/2014/04/09/owncloud-client-1-6-the-tour/">this blog by Danimo</a>.</li></ul><br><div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><h2>Devel mailing list discussions</h2>The entire month saw lots of bugfixes fly by on the devel mailing list. The news app, for example, now deals better with a host of websites, but also got reworked to be finally independent from the app framework. Meanwhile, there's a <a href="https://github.com/Apophenia/news-ff-feeds">firefox plugin being developed for the News app</a>, courtesy of our <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/Outreach-Program-for-Women">Outreach Program for Women participation</a>.<br><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Kl6ztryJ494/U3PJX3IIaWI/AAAAAAAAOos/kab83HpDswg/s1600/bug+reports.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Kl6ztryJ494/U3PJX3IIaWI/AAAAAAAAOos/kab83HpDswg/s1600/bug+reports.png" height="400" width="316"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Visual bugreports with screenshots.</td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>Listing apps</h3>Jan-Christoph announced that he had put together a page listing the central ownCloud apps as well as mobile and desktop clients. There is also a section 'external apps to integrate with'. With this overview he hopes to encourage collaboration over fragmentation. <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/Apps">See the page here</a>.<br><br>Vincent Petry brought a <a href="https://github.com/PVince81/pyocclient">python client library</a> to the ownCloud list, spawning a discussion about the need for perhaps a JavaScript library as well.<br><br><h2>In other news</h2>The bugfix release <a href="https://owncloud.com/blog/owncloud-6-0-3-released">ownCloud 6.0.3</a> brought new bugfixes and <a href="http://www.arthur-schiwon.de/ldap-owncloud-603-improved-performance-and-more">improved LDAP performance</a>.<br><br>The wider FOSS world saw Canonical retire Ubuntu One, to which we replied offering Ubuntu users to come and <a href="https://owncloud.com/blog/canonical-ubuntu-one-users-come-check-owncloud">try out ownCloud</a>. As Frank wrote when Box announced they'd open source some of the tools they use in-house for system administration and engineering:<br><blockquote>"Depending on a vendor is always risky: the vendor can go bankrupt, be bought or raise prices. In the world of web services it also often happens that vendors decide to discontinue functionality they deem not crucial enough. It could just be something you depend on!"</blockquote>ownCloud can be run on your own servers, not requiring you to move your data to an untrusted, third-party server farm." See <a href="https://owncloud.com/blog/value-proposition-open-source">his blog post</a>.<br><br><h2>Conclusion</h2>I hope you liked the ownCloud news of April! Obviously, the weekly ones should be shorter than this one. Let me know in the comments what you think about doing this every week. If you all think it is a good idea, I'll move this to the ownCloud blog.&nbsp;</div></div>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<center><a href="http://owncloud.comuv.com/Upload/images/csc0177.jpg"><img src="http://owncloud.comuv.com/Upload/images/csc0177.jpg" width="80%" height="80%"></a></center><br>One more fan-freakin-tastik openSUSE conference is over. Thank you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik" target="1">Dubrovnik</a> and local organizers for such fantabulous conference. Your city is beautiful. Too bad that the weather wasn't sunny all the time (don't forget that Dubrovnik is touristic city). The old city was dope. I mean it's very cool to stay inside the walls, go to school there. Of course restaurants, bars etc are expensive there, but still it's so cool!!!<br><br>Personally don't understand why everyone in the community linked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik#In_popular_culture" target="1">Dubrovnik with Game of thrones series</a>. It's a Hollywood product. Maybe I'm the only one that don't watch it. On the other hand, I saw the cruelty of civil war during 91-94 and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Dubrovnik" target="1">siege of Dubrovnik</a> that lasted for 7 months. Of course a theme couldn't use that, since it's politics (although Game of Thrones has copyrights and it's better not to use it either). <br><br><center><a href="http://owncloud.comuv.com/Upload/images/dsc0200.jpg"><img src="http://owncloud.comuv.com/Upload/images/dsc0200.jpg" width="80%" height="80%"></a><br>Greeks, Brazilians, Germans and Czechs.</center><a name="more"></a><br>People there were kind and happy to help us. During the last 2 days of the conference, there was a religious youth festival and the city was too crowded. Good for us to mingle but the transportation to and from the venue was kind of difficult for everyone.<br><br>Now let's talk about the conference. I was volunteer. My duty was to keep social media updated. I didn't have time to attend to many presentations I had to watch if streaming was on, sound was OK and inform the video team if there was a problem.<br>This year, there wasn't an organized press room, so I could do this job from anywhere. So I took my netbook and sometimes I was in the presentations room, sometimes I was sitting at the GNOME Booth.  <br><br>I also managed to bring swag and organize the GNOME booth. Thank you <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KostasLivieratos/posts" target="1">Kostas Livieratos</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/109771781417097774518/posts" target="1">Anna Angelogianni</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/100698378976152085216/posts" target="1">Apostolis Ntokos</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/101572283611606913445/posts" target="1">Tobias Mueller</a> that helped to have a great GNOME presence at openSUSE conference.<br><br>Regarding presentations, thank <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_AMhvchzBaexmeFXo2zfjQTV0XxaMliS" target="1">openSUSEtv</a>, I saw them when I got back home. Here some highlights:<br><br>1. Since I'm not tech person, I like almost all Jos' presentations. My fav was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KufI7O3apZI" target="1">tips about the booths and presence</a>. It was something that I studied and presented at openSUSE conference 2012. If we combine the presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm5JUW6byq0" target="1">Social Skills for Geeks</a>, we will have a better result to our community. Also another cool presentation was his tips to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-9wou7Vog" target="1">build a community in 10 steps</a>. Since I'm passionate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UztJ5OEvEvw" target="1">about ownCloud</a>, it was good opportunity for me to watch what the new community manager has to say about it.<br><br>2. Of course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qQnlogmato" target="1">Tobias' presentation about GNOME</a> was something that I watched (since I didn't make it to see him live). I presented many things that he told us here in Greece. I used the new version 3.12 and I'm very excited about it. Richard Brown told us that new version is in Tumbleweed repos and on a stable repository so users can use it.<br><br>3. A must see presentation is <a href="http://youtu.be/G-r_ML-MnMo" target="1">Design and Branding - The Way Forward by Ken Wimer</a>. Branding and new design is what makes the difference to every product (not only software). Typography, fonts, slides and how to present is what matters.<br><br>4. As part of the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program" target="1">Travel Support committee</a>, I presented a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQD7dc01nIc" target="1">part about the program</a>, but Ancor's presentation about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDA4ccqp570" target="1">how to use the TSP application to request for reimbursement</a>, is the presentation we should use for future questions how to use the <a href="https://connect.opensuse.org/travel-support" target="1">TSP tool</a>.<br><br>Personal highlights is that I met with Tobias Mueller. We used to mail each other about GNOME. Now I met him AFK. <br><br>Also another highlight was that I met Michal Meeks. He had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOa8sMQPG14" target="1">keynote presentation about The Document Foundation and LibreOffice</a>.<br><br><center><a href="http://owncloud.comuv.com/Upload/images/meeks.jpg"><img src="http://owncloud.comuv.com/Upload/images/meeks.jpg" width="80%" height="80%"></a><br><br>Anna, Apostolis, Wookey, Me, Francoise, Michael, Kostas</center><br>For more pictures you can check <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/113385548251515365143/113385548251515365143/photos" target="1">Google Plus Greece</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/c8v2n62kf4dqqt2odqb1aub88fg" target="1">Google Plus event page</a>.<br><br>I hope I covered everything. Now the future. Next openSUSE conference will take place in The Hague. Thank to Hans de Raad. I'll see you next year!!!<br><br>I would like to thank openSUSE that sponsored part of my expenses for this conference.]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week saw several events in Berlin&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.station-berlin.de/" target="_blank">Station</a> event location that also featured ownCloud in one way or the other. The first, <a href="http://re-publica.de/" target="_blank">re:publica</a>, is probably mostly known by bloggers and internet activists. Titled <em>Into the wild</em>, an obvious tongue in cheek about the unsafe and well-surveilled place the internet has become, it was a great place to talk about ownCloud. <a href="http://blog.karlitschek.de/" target="_blank">Frank</a> took that opportunity and was received by a packed room, to which he delivered a <a href="https://www.voicerepublic.com/venues/197/talks/171">talk about ownCloud</a>, despite <a href="http://www.dw.de/republica-2014-digital-natives-summit-to-tackle-surveillance-and-online-freedoms/a-17613110">The Hoff</a> performing on Stage 1 at the same time.</p>
<p></p><div><a href="https://daniel.molkentin.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/05/1_small.jpg"><img src="https://daniel.molkentin.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/05/1_small-150x150.jpg" alt="Jos and Arthur at a freshly set up booth." width="150" height="150"></a><p>Jos and Arthur at a freshly set up booth.</p></div>The last day of re:publica coincided with the first day of <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/2014/">LinuxTag 2014</a>, which moved from Fairgrounds to Station Berlin. This brought a lot of new people to visit our booth, which ownCloud shared with openSUSE and KDE, courtesy of our new Community Manager <a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/">Jos</a>.
<p>On Thursday, <strong>Frank and I also got invited and interviewed about ownCloud</strong> by the <em>Sondersendung</em> Podcast. If you can understand German, you can listen to our <a href="http://das-sendezentrum.de/sondersendung/sz010-open-source-fuer-alle#t=42:16" target="_blank">15 minute interview</a> .</p>

Every day of LinuxTag, quite some people took the chance to listen and ask questions.
<p>Others just walked up to our demo point for a quick demonstration of ownClouds capabilities and concepts. Some inquired about the improvements from earlier versions they have used, and most were impressed by the progress that ownCloud 6 and ownCloud Client 1.6 represent. Since LinuxTag joined forces with <a href="http://de.droidcon.com/2014/" target="_blank">droidcon</a>, we also had lots of <strong>questions on our mobile integration</strong> for Android (and iOS, :), for both ownCloud app and calendar/addressbook sync.</p>
<p>In total, LinuxTag has been a really great show this year, which was mostly owed to the co-location with other events and the more central location. We&rsquo;re looking forward to LinuxTag 2015!</p>

Today we had a short discussion with my mentor (Morris) on IRC and set up some new debugger tools (Node.js and NPM). Also discussed on problems that I had during the week.

   <description><![CDATA[As the header says I will no longer be part of the ownCloud contributors. It has been a major - not to say the main - part of of life for the past 2&frac12; years; they do roll by, don't they...<br>
When I started it was as most hobby-programmers just to scratch my own itch, but it has been a great joy and pleasure to work with the many enthusiatic people.<br>
When Frank started his company around the project I was just as happy and gladly signed a contributors agreement for my few contributions to ownCloud core.<br><br>
The ownCloud project was for me both as mentioned to scratch my own itch regarding many points, but also a way for me to heal my own mind with some brainwork that I hadn't been able to do elsewhere. For personal reasons I'd been out of a job - unable to perform it - but after I had my disability pension I could have some peace and let me try to build some strength.<br>
It helped a lot to work with these great people.<br><br>
Lately - for the better part of 1&frac12; year - this hasn't been my feeling. I may be wrong but it is my strong feeling that ownCloud Inc. has become the priority, and the community a workbench for improving and taking over the apps.<br>

If this is not so, keep doing your awesome work.<br>

For those having the same feeling as me, I urge you to form an ownCloud Foundation. I don't have the strength myself, but I will gladly join and support it.<br>

Frank, I'd wished you'd seen and supported it<br><br>

Sorry for all errors in this text; this is for me a very emotional departure.<br><br>
Edit: I'll explain my reasons for leaving and my wishes for the future of the ownCloud community further soon. At this moment I just need to gather my thoughts first.<br><br>
Below a redacted excerpt of what triggered it. It may not seem important, but if you know your github-foo your can find find it all<br><br><pre>
 karlitschek commented 2 days ago

Sorry but we don&acute;t want to dumb more libraries in the ownCloud core only because they might be useful. Apps are free to ship components like that if they want to use it. At the later stage if 4-5 apps ship the same component in the exact same version then we might consider to add the to the ownCloud core, or not.
:-1:

 karlitschek commented 2 days ago

I'm not saying this is not useful, secure, good code or in other ways helpful. But this doesn't mean that we should dump all useful code into the core. The design goal of the owncloud core is to be as small as possible. In fact it is already too big. So if this is useful then we should use it for the news app API first and perhaps other apps. This doesn't mean that we have to dump it into the core to make it heavier, difficult to maintain and to keep stable

 tanghus commented 21 hours ago

As it has been - wisely - decided to move the AppFramework to core, I am interested in having it both lean, but more importantly usable and secure. Therefore I prefer to have great implementations which are closely scrutinized for security issues.
A security issue that would be present in at least 3 apps has already been detected. I think that speaks for itself for including it in core.

 tanghus commented 9 hours ago

In case my point didn't come clearly thru, as I may sometimes try to soften my views when putting them into words.

    The design goal of the owncloud core is to be as small as possible. In fact it is already too big.

Recommendable, but what does that exactly mean? What is not needed in core? archive, migration, memcache, ocs, vobject, activitymanager, api, avatar, backgroundjob, cache, contactsmanager, tags, eventsource or files for that matter? Plus everything else under /apps. Fine, lets scrap it and start from scratch. I can actually mention a few that I wouldn't be missed (including some of my contributions), but that's another matter.

Design-wise it would probably be good, but we would be left with basically nothing.

Some of the good decisions that have been made during the past ~1&frac12; year - from my PoV - are

    The strict adherence to interfaces in new contributions
    The introduction of the Server "container"
    The (partly) inclusion of the AppFramework.

Those - and other - changes can make it possible to actually move towards a mature, trustworthy codebase.
I have no special attachments to including CORS middleware, but I understand from several parties, that I trust, that it is a small, yet important part to include, and rejecting it as bloat is both disrespectful and counter-productive. So my rant is not about CORS - it's about the culture and attitude that I sometimes see in this community. What I seen is community members reluctant to voice their opinions for improvements.
To say it straight out: The community should have priority over both "The Inc." and "The Founder". Otherwise it's not a community anymore, and I don't see a place for myself in it.
Alternatively the two quoted nouns could find better ways for making compromises - without compromising the project - pun intended ;)
If none of those objects are met I frighten for the future culture of this project, but so be it; I find another place to try to keep my mind sound, because quite honestly recently it has done quite the opposite[*]

[*] With exceptions of course. No one mentioned, no one forgotten.

PS: I've tried to keep this rant in a sober tone, although my state might not be so (otherwise I probably wouldn't have written it) and I expect any responses to it to be made in public.

@tanghus Thanks a lot. I don&acute;t think this has anything to do with Inc. or anything else.
This is purely about the long term maintainability of the core. And this is something anything who wants that ownCloud still exists in 5-10 years should care about.
We all know several other projects where this framework/libraries bloat went wrong.

O.K. Let&acute;s put this into core under this conditions:

    Full documentation how this should be used by app developers is available on doc.owncloud.org at the same time.
    At least two independent apps are fully ported to use this.
    @Raydiation maintains this for the time being exactly as the rest of the app framework.

    Someone actively

    Someone starts to port other pieces of ownCloud to use this so that we don&acute;t have code duplication.

Additionally we should also regularly check which code, frameworks or dependencies in core can be removed. Otherwise we run into a long term problem.

    Full documentation how this should be used by app developers is available on doc.owncloud.org
    at the same time.

Reasonable and preferable.

    At least two independent apps are fully ported to use this.

I believe that should be the case for oC7 or oC8. Longterm dev is of essence.

    @Raydiation maintains this for the time being exactly as the rest of the app framework.

I think this should be rephrased to "there must always be an active, responsible maintainer." which is documented in the source file. I don't know if there's a @maintainer tag in http://www.phpdoc.org/ ?
That it should always be @Raydiation counts out the bus-factor ;)
Also where would that that place all other core developers including you Frank? We have git blame and I've been personally hit by that recently ;)

    Someone actively

Meaning what? If it's correct it doesn't have to change. This correlates with the maintainer or other developers related to this.

    Someone starts to port other pieces of ownCloud to use this so that we don&acute;t have code duplication.

Agreed.

    Additionally we should also regularly check which code, frameworks or dependencies in core can be removed. Otherwise we run into a long term problem.

This should be addressed in a separate issue and I'm sorry @XXX that I kinda hijacked this issue for that.

    This is purely about the long term maintainability of the core. And this is something anything who wants that ownCloud still exists in 5-10 years should care about.

To be very forthright I'm not not sure which ownCloud you mean here? Is it to be sure independent developers can produce efficient and secure code, or is it to secure that the Inc. have less dependencies when they use their paid work force to make solid apps for paying customers?
The arguments and motives have become too opaque for me, and after 2&frac12; years of mostly enjoying this project, I'll have to retract myself from it.

@XXX sorry for misusing this PR.

@tanghus I&acute;m not really sure what you mean here. Like I said this has nothing to do with Inc. or anything else.
We all have invested a lot of time and energy into ownCloud. So it is in our all interested that the ownCloud core and the apps will be maintainable and stable and working and mostly bugfree for as long as possible. Because of that we have to do some quality check when architectural changes are done in the core. I think this is good maintainership in general.

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi!<br><br>In this category, I will be posting the progress that I am on with <strong>GSoC</strong> and <strong>ownCloud</strong>.<br><br>First, I should tell more about <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/" target="_blank">GSoC</a>. GSoC (Google Summer of Code) is a program supported by Google to encourage students to code for Open Source software. And this year is the tenth year of this program. There are <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/list/public/google/gsoc2014" target="_blank">190 open source organizations</a> and more than 1300 students ready to code for open source. And me... I am one of them this year.</p>
<p>It is my first time in GSoC and I am so glad to be a part of a great community: <a href="http://owncloud.org/" target="_blank">ownCloud</a>.<br><br>Just after I have heard about <strong>ownCloud</strong> as an open source replacement of Dropbox/GoogleDrive/SkyDrive, I was totally amazed and installed on my Kubuntu laptop.</p>
<p>Just like the excitement after buying a new phone, I started playing with it to learn as many features as possible. Here, I am not gonna talk about how powerful and great software it is, but the development status of my project in GSoC: Playlist Functionality for ownCloud Music App.<br><br>The following part is copy/paste from my proposal:</p>
<p><strong>ownCloud</strong> is an open source file sync and share software for everyone. Its features can be expanded by installing applications. One of the applications of ownCloud is a Music Application which collects the music files on the user's folder and plays them.<br><br>My idea is to add a playlist functionality to this application. This functionality will have the following features:<br><br></p>
<ul><li>Use your browser to play your songs using created playlists</li>
<li>Basic playlist operations can be done by web interface: Create/rename/remove playlists.</li>
<li>Drag and drop files</li>
<li>Since ownCloud is being used in all browsers, it will be only possible to play MP3 and maybe OGG files to support all of them.</li>
</ul><p>In the future, these playlists could be shared to public or specific users for music streaming like online radio stations. Also, other file formats could be played after conversion with usage of some libraries.<br><br>From next week, I will be posting more detailed report about my progress. Until next time...<br><br>Happy hacking!<br><br></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on">Today, I blog about blogging. My goal is to convince you, hard working contributor to KDE, ownCloud or openSUSE, that you should regularly blog about the awesome you do.<br><h2>Blogging is great</h2>Contributors blogging about what they do is awesome, really. This way, we:<br><ul><li>Share knowledge <small>so others don't have to re-invent the wheel</small></li><li>Share ideas <small>so others know what we're up to and can help improve plans</small></li><li>Get help <small>so readers might feel compelled to help out!</small></li><li>Give help <small>so using ownCloud/KDE/openSUSE/etc becomes easier for people</small></li><li>Increase our visibility <small>so users/developers know who to <strike>beat up</strike> talk to</small></li><li>Create some noise for the outside <small>forums, news sites, magazines etc - press in general</small></li></ul><br>And that's all absolutely awesome. I even bet there are at least 3 more reasons why blogging is good for your community and I hereby offer cookies for whoever shares three other reasons in the comments section.<br><br>But let's be honest. Who cares about how it benefits whatever? It's the age of <em>me me</em> and more <em>me</em>!<br><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/komodoro/14081824673" title="Balsa de pardelas by Paco Lopez, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2912/14081824673_7e01be5884_z.jpg" width="640" height="213" alt="Balsa de pardelas"></a><br><h2>But what really matters...</h2>So I want to make clear that <strong>YOU benefit</strong>. Taking time off to write down what you're working on, putting ideas in order&mdash;this is incredibly useful. You will not only become a better writer but also a better thinker. Better at expressing your ideas but also better at putting them in order, examining them, refining them.<br><br>Blogging makes you stop and <em>think</em> about what you are doing. You take a little time to dive a bit deeper in what drives you, why you work on what you work on and how you can do better.<br><br>This should make clear that the idea of "I have nothing to say" makes no sense. If you are doing things, you must be thinking about them. Blogging is just thinking out loud. Which helps YOU think and, as I pointed out above, helps others see what you think about and give you input.<br><div><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/locksleynet/14058684542" title="London phone box. by Locksley McPherson Jnr, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2914/14058684542_bb086ee06c_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="London phone box."></a></div><h2>HOW to do it then?</h2>I'm not going to say writing is simple. If you look up the first posts on my blog, well, let's just say it didn't come by itself for me either. You might be looking at a blank page for a while. But it gets easy when you have something to say! If you're enthusiastic about something or pondering a complicated problem, <b>that</b> is the moment to start. Open your favorite text editor and just blurt down your thoughts, why you're happy/angry/enthusiastic/etc.<br><br>Then structure it a bit, try to explain the things. You might have learned this in the past already: explaining something complicated to somebody else is awesome, because you learn from doing that yourself. Maybe even more than the person you're explaining to!<br>Then make it more presentable. Add a few headers above big paragraphs to break it up, maybe add a picture. Flickr is a great source of pics and it makes your blog a bit lighter, but it is not mandatory at all. Then just publish. Because, really, you can polish forever but it will never be perfect. And you learn while writing. So write, publish, and write some more!<br><br>On the idea of "you must do regular writing": <b>a myth</b>. Yes, writing about what you did last week is helpful. It gives a base to start with, keeps your life organized. But it is <strong>not</strong> The Only Way To Success when it comes to blogging. You need a bit of inspiration. I've gone months without blogs, and had weeks with several. That might not be awesome from a '<i>social media</i>' perspective but really, who gives a rats' ass about that? I know I don't.<br><br>Write when you are thinking about something, when you're inspired. That's enough.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2>Blogging is helpful. Most people don't feel compelled to share their expertise, knowledge and ideas. That is OK, of course - but if you are willing to blog, please do it! It isn't as hard as it sometimes feels and it is more helpful for yourself than you might think.<br><br>And if your project has a blog roll like <a href="http://planet.kde.org/">planet KDE</a>, <a href="http://planet.opensuse.org/">planet openSUSE</a> and <a href="http://owncloud.org/news">ownCloud News</a>, get your blog on there! More readers = more comments = more motivation and more value for <em>you</em>. Really!<br><br>For the ownCloud folk: contact me if you want your blog on our blog roll. I'd be happy to add it!</div>]]></description>

   <title>LDAP in ownCloud 6.0.3: improved performance and more</title>
   <link>http://arthur-schiwon.de/ldap-owncloud-603-improved-performance-and-more</link>

   <pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
   <description><![CDATA[<div><div><div><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://arthur-schiwon.de/sites/default/files/ldap-mosaic.png" width="1072" height="351" alt=""></div></div></div><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>In about a week we release version 6.0.3 of ownCloud Community Edition! It is a maintenance release that includes nearly two months of improvements (including performance improvements) and some fixes. I want to use this opportunity to shed some light on the fixes the LDAP back-end has seen.</p>
<p>There are no big things, however, but the performance improvements in sharing related methods and in the configuration wizard will significantly enhance the experience for end users and admins. The following list is not a complete one, but addresses the most notable changes.</p>
<h3>Faster user retrieval in sharing dialogue</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.arthur-schiwon.de/sites/default/files/share.png"><img src="http://arthur-schiwon.de/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/share.png?itok=jjNtWjeM" width="220" height="77" alt=""></a>By optimizing the behavior in fetching and caching the display name, additional per user queries to the LDAP server are not necessary anymore. Fortunately, it was a low hanging fruit, because we requested the attribute on the original search query already. The missing piece was to push the value to the LDAP cache. The result, obviously, is that users will appear faster in the share dialogue and the number of LDAP queries is reduced.</p>
<h3>Regular updates of email (and quota)</h3>
<p>Users really appreciate the feature to send email notifications when sharing files. Now, they found out that LDAP users were not notified, although the <a href="http://doc.owncloud.org/server/6.0/admin_manual/configuration/auth_ldap.html#special-attributes">email attribute was configured properly</a>. Well, yes, the email was only fetched upon login. If a user never logged in before, for example, the email address would not have been known to ownCloud. Previously, this was totally OK as there was no big use for the email address nevertheless, but things are different today.</p>
<p>Now, user details like user quota and the email address will be fetched initially with mapping of the user (one-time happening) and on the regular user exists check (with utilizing the LDAP cache). So the email address will be accurate whenever the notification will be used.</p>
<h3>More reliable Configuration Wizard</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.arthur-schiwon.de/owncloud-6-community-edition-beta-1-ships-collaborative-editing-and-new-wizard-ldap-settings">LDAP Wizard</a> has seen two major improvements. First, when determining the object classes in the User and Group Filter tabs, it does not look at every available object anymore. A nasty mistake by missing to implement a limitation. Now, only three LDAP objects will be looked at, which reduces the detection time massively, especially with bigger LDAP setups. <a href="http://www.arthur-schiwon.de/sites/default/files/first-three-tabs-stage-reflected-background.png"><img src="http://www.arthur-schiwon.de/sites/default/files/first-three-tabs-stage-reflected-background-m.png" alt="LDAP settings screenshot composition"></a></p>
<p>Another issue has been a race condition that could lead to a reset (respectively automatic compilation) of the LDAP filters. No undesired surprises any more.</p>
<h3>More accurate reporting</h3>
<p>Do you know the ownCloud command line client? It gives the administrator some tools for managing ownCloud that are handy to not (only) have in the web interface. There is also a method to get the total number of users, <tt>user:report</tt>. In LDAP we need to count the whole result set for this. If available (depending on PHP version and LDAP server configuration), we work with paged results. Well, we should, and we do since now also in this case.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arthur-schiwon.de/sites/default/files/occ.png"><img src="http://arthur-schiwon.de/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/occ.png?itok=e4JJZEMg" width="220" height="62" alt=""></a> This allows us to get a specific total number from Active Directory. For OpenLDAP however, the configured size limit on the LDAP server is the maximum number of results we can get. It is because OpenLDAP follows a suggestion of the awkward <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2696">RFC 2696</a> (section 6) and AD does not (guess who wrote the RFC).</p>
<h3>FreeIPA compatibility</h3>
<p>Good news for FreeIPA users: Robin McCorkell (thank you!) added support for the UUID attribute used in FreeIPA so the configuration will work right out of the box without any changes in the expert settings.</p>
<h3>ownCloud 6.0.3 RC</h3>
<p><a href="http://mailman.owncloud.org/pipermail/testpilots/2014-April/000132.html">ownCloud 6.0.3 is currently in the Release Candidate</a> stage. With so many different setups out there in the wild we always appreciate testers. So, if you have some time left, please get it and poke around! Also, the <a href="http://owncloud.org/releases/Changelog">temporary changelog</a> is available.</p>

I look forward to Dubrovnik, although I see it will be rainy and not that warm. Ah, sad...<br><h2>LinuxTag 2014 - all change</h2>A much bigger deal, for me, is <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag</a>. This year, it is considerably different from the previous few years: no more in the Messe! Instead, the team is collaborating with DroidCon and Re:Publica. That, combined with the location (Station in Berlin), could potentially be awesome! Here I give one talk about the future of KDE. I'll also be speaking at the <a href="http://www.cls-europe.com/">Community Leadership Summit Europe</a> about Open Governance.<br><br>But more importantly, I'll be organizing the LT booth for three projects: ownCloud, KDE and openSUSE. Yeah, ambitious again! Not only that, we're not going for the traditional booth. Instead, I've proposed to do something different: have a track of technical mini-workshops at the booth. 45 minute talks, small, hands-on, about the technology of these projects. So, think about <i>building packages with the Open Build Service</i>, <i>writing an ownCloud App</i> or <i>developing a QML based Plasma widget</i>.<br><div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-piNR8qmke5c/UaNpykO7o_I/AAAAAAAADqQ/gkRAI4McjMI/s1600/the+club+mate.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-piNR8qmke5c/UaNpykO7o_I/AAAAAAAADqQ/gkRAI4McjMI/s320/the+club+mate.jpg"></a></div><br><h3>Needing some help</h3>The idea seems generally liked but I haven't found anybody for any of the three above potential talks - so if you can and want to do that or something like it, please let me know! We won't have too much traditional booth space, just enough for a bit of stuff and one or two ppl answering questions. The talks will repeat every day so as volunteer, you give your talk 3 times, once every day. Otherwise you are free to enjoy the talks as well as the Re:Publica booth area. As the tickets are not cheap (Eur 149!) this is a nice way to get into LinuxTag for free (I have only 2 tickets per booth, though). You'll get hugs and Club Mate as much as you want. And there's travel support available for all these projects!<br><br>Help me out, please! And if you can't - at least, be sure to visit the booth at LinuxTag or come say hi at the openSUSE Conference!</div>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://daniel.molkentin.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/04/Padlock-olive.png" alt="Engage Padlock!" width="200" height="200">Throughout the recent months (and particularly: weeks), people have asked me how to properly secure their SSL/TLS communication, particularly on web servers. At the same time I&rsquo;ve started to look for good&nbsp;literature on SSL/TLS. I noticed that many of the &ldquo;guides&rdquo; on how to do a good SSL/TLS setup <strong>are&nbsp;actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a></strong>. Cargo cult is a really dangerous thing for two reasons: First of all,<strong>&nbsp;security is never a one-size-fits-all solution</strong>. Your setup needs to work in your environment, taking into account possible limitation imposed by hardware or software in your infrastructure. And secondly, some of those guides are <strong>outdated</strong>, e.g. they do neglect the clear need for Perfect Forward Secrecy, or use&nbsp;now-insecure ciphers. At the worst case, they are simply <strong>wrong</strong>. So I won&rsquo;t be providing yet another soon-outdated tutorial that leaves you non-the-wiser. Instead, I&rsquo;ll share my collection of free and for-pay documents, books and resources on the topic which I found particularly useful in the hope that they may help you in gaining some insight.</p>
<h2>Introduction to SSL/TLS</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with SSL/TLS, you definitely should take half an hour to read the <em>Crypto primer</em>, and bookmark <em>SSL/TLS Strong Encryption: An Introduction</em> for reference.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/b/plankytronixx/archive/2010/10/28/crypto-primer-how-does-ssl-work.aspx">Crypto Primer: How does SSL work?</a>&nbsp;sums up the functionality of SSL/TLS</li>
<li><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/ssl/ssl_intro.html">SSL/TLS Strong Encryption: An Introduction</a> is less of an introduction than a very elaborate glossary of SSL/TLS and crypto terminology</li>
</ul><h2>Deploying SSL/TLS</h2>
<p>So you want to get your hands dirty? Check your server setup with Qualys SSL Labs&rsquo; server test. Make sure you fix the most important issues. You should at least be able to get an &ldquo;A-&rdquo; grading. If you find yourself in trouble (and are the administrator of an Apache or nginx setup), you should read the <em>OpenSSL cookbook</em>. Professional system administrators should have <em>Bulletproof SSL/TLS and PKI</em> on the shelf/eBook reader.<sup><a href="https://daniel.molkentin.net/#1">1)</a></sup></p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/">Qualys SSL Labs</a> is a web site that can analyze the quality of a given SSL/TLS setup (HTTP only) using a nice rating scheme <sup><a href="https://daniel.molkentin.net/#2">2)</a></sup> and providing hints on how to easily improve your setup.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.feistyduck.com/books/bulletproof-ssl-tls-and-pki/">Bulletproof SSL/TLS and PKI</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Subtitled <em>The Complete Guide to Securely Using SSL/TLS and PKI in Infrastructure Deployment and Web Application Development</em>, this book is still work in progress (and is constantly updated, also according to readers feedback). Its author, Ivan Risti&#263;, is also the guy&nbsp;behind ssllabs.com. While not finished, a preview eBook is available for &pound;19 (roughly &euro;23 or $32). Purchasers will receive the full eBook once finished. You can also pre-order a hard copy</li>
<li><a href="https://www.feistyduck.com/books/openssl-cookbook/">OpenSSL Cookbook</a>&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp;Extended excerpt from <em>Bulletproof SSL/TLS and PKI</em>. Suitable to secure your web server. Free download (requires registration).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS">Up-to-date cipher suite recommendation</a> from Mozilla with detailed explanation on why it was chosen. (<em>Thanks to Tom Brossman</em>).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hass.de/content/setup-your-iis-ssl-perfect-forward-secrecy-and-tls-12">Efficiently picking PFS-compatible cipher suites for IIS (using PowerShell).</a></li>
</ul><h2>The SSL, the TLS and the Ugly</h2>
<p>If you are a dedicated IT professional, you should not miss the next section. Although it&rsquo;s not crucial for those wishing to &ldquo;simply secure their server&rdquo;, it provides those who are responsible for data security with a clear understanding of the numerous theoretical and practical limitations of SSL/TLS.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.westpoint.ltd.uk/papers/ssl-paved-with-good-intentions.pdf">SSL: Paved with Good Intentions</a>: Presentation on history and weaknesses of SSL/TLS by Richard Moore, CTO at Westpoint Ltd and the maintainer of the Qt SSL/TLS stack.</li>

</ul><h2>Tools and Utilities for Debugging SSL/TLS</h2>
<p>Sometimes you need to debug errors during the SSL handshake. While a bit primitive, OpenSSL&rsquo;s&nbsp;s_client tool is the weapon of choice. When it comes to monitoring SSL/TLS encrypted communications, use mitmproxy or Charles. They need to be added as proxies, but can also intercept PFS connections, due to their active MITM position.</p>

<li><a title="OpenSSL s_client" href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/s_client.html">openssl s_client</a> is a command line tool that provides details on the handshake phase and establishes a secure connection. Use it to debug problems with certificate chaining, OCSP stapling, etc.</li>

</ul><p>This list is not exhaustive and if you have more suggestions, please go ahead and post them in the comments. I&rsquo;ll be happy to add them. Finally, just like&nbsp;with system administration in general, you&rsquo;re never &ldquo;done&rdquo; with security. SSL/TLS is a swiftly moving target, and you need to be aware of what is going on. If you are an IT professional, subscribe to <a href="http://seclists.org/">security mailing lists</a> and the announcement lists of your vendor. Finally, while I&rsquo;m aiming to update this page, there&rsquo;s never a guarantee of up-to-dateness for this list either. <strong>Update</strong> (22.04.2014): Don&rsquo;t miss the discussion on this article over at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7620458">Hacker News</a>.</p>
<h2>Article History</h2>
<ul><li>21.04.2014 &ndash; Initial version</li>
<li>21.04.2014 -&nbsp;Added &ldquo;The Case for OCSP-Must-Staple&rdquo;, Mozilla Cipher suite recommendation</li>
<li>22.04.2014 &ndash; Updated to add sslyze and cipherscan, added HN link, fixed typos</li>
<li>02.05.2014 &ndash; Add &ldquo;Analyzing Forged SSL Certificate&rdquo; paper</li>
</ul><p><span>1) I do realize that I am courting Ivan a lot in this section and that relying on only an&nbsp;a single&nbsp;external web service that can go away any day is not a good thing. At the same time I think that the handshake simulation and the simple rating process are priceless, as&nbsp;such assessment cannot be trivially done by&nbsp;people whom&rsquo;s life does not revolve around crypto and security 24/7. At the same time, I&rsquo;m happy for any pointers towards other, user friendly tools.</span></p>
<p><span>2) While blindly following the rating can easily lead to the establishment of cargo cult, ssllabs.com is continuously updated to only give those a good grading that follow the best pactices. Again: <strong>Avoid Cargo Cult</strong>, make sure you have a good idea of what you are doing.</span></p>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Now that <a href="http://owncloud.org/sync-clients/#testing">ownCloud 1.6.0 beta1</a> is out, it&rsquo;s time to explain the story behind it:</p>
<p><a href="https://daniel.molkentin.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/owncloud-icon-2561.png"><img src="https://daniel.molkentin.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/owncloud-icon-2561.png" alt="owncloud-icon-256" width="256" height="256"></a>This release was developed under the promise that it would <strong>improve performance</strong> <sup>1)</sup>, and we have made tremendous improvements: Using a new Qt-based propagator implementation, we can now <strong>perform multiple simultaneous up- and downloads</strong>. We still provide the old propagator for certain situation where it&rsquo;s more suitable, such as for situations where bandwidth limitation is needed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <strong>sync journal access code</strong> has been <strong>significantly optimized</strong>. It paid tribute to most of the high CPU load during the mandatory interval checks. CPU usage should be much lower now, and the client should be usable with more files at the same time.</p>
<p>Windows users should also find update times improved as the <strong>time spent in file stat operations has been reduced</strong>. <strong>Mac OS X</strong> users will enjoy the benefits of a <strong>much improved file watcher</strong>. To be able to use the more efficient API, 1.6 drops support for Mac OS Snow Leopard (10.6) and now requires Mac OS 10.7 or better.</p>
<p>At the same time, production releases are now using Qt 5 rather than Qt 4 on Windows and Mac OS X<sup>2)</sup>. This fixes <strong>a lot of visual bugs in Mac OS X, especially for Mavericks users</strong>, and allows us to profit from improvements in the SSL handling, especially on the Mac.</p>
<p>We also implemented an item that was on many peoples wish list: <strong>a concise sync log</strong>. Next to the database, the sync folder now holds a hidden file called <code>.owncloudsync.log</code>. It will store all sync processes in a minimal CSV file. Contrary to previous logging facilities, it always logs and only collects information relevant to the actual sync algorithm decisions.</p>
<p>Because this tour was not as colorful as the previous one, let&rsquo;s close this blog post with a feature contributed by Denis Dzyubenko: The settings dialog on Mac OS X now has a native look &amp; feel:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnsfbLl-s80">Watch on Youtube</a></p>
<p>Get ownCloud Client 1.6.0 beta1 <a href="http://owncloud.org/sync-clients/#testing">now</a> and <a href="http://github.com/owncloud/mirall/issues">provide feedback</a>!</p>
<p><strong><sup>1)</sup></strong> Now that while the client is multi-threaded, you may find that the transfer time still doesn&rsquo;t improve as much as you would expect. This is due locking issues on the server which prevent efficient parallel transfers. This has been improved in 1.7, and could potentilly improved even further <a href="https://github.com/fruux/sabre-dav/issues/120">by implementing support for <code>X-Sendfile</code>/<code>X-Accel-Redirect</code> in SabreDAV</a>, the DAV framework used by ownCloud server.</p>
<p><strong><sup>2)</sup></strong> We can&rsquo;t do the switch even on modern Linux distributions mostly due of the poor support for modern and divergent Systray/Notification area support in Qt5: Even in Qt 4 we could only use it because Canonical had patched their Qt to make <code>QSystemTrayIcon</code> work with Unity, which they have not ported to Qt 5 yet. Gnome 3 also hides away traditional Systray icons way to well, not to speak of Plasma. Any leads would be helpful.</p>
<p>PS: <a href="http://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2014/03/system-tray-in-plasma-next/">Martin&rsquo;s blog on the subject</a> indicates that Qt 5.3 might solve the problem.</p>]]></description>

Like in my <a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2010/07/new-job.html">previous gig at SUSE</a>, I consider the 'manager' part of the title to be about helping out the community wherever I can. To put it less graphically than Frank did: you get another person to talk to when you think we can improve things.<br><br>I'm excited to get started and find out what should be done. Of course I have thoughts and ideas on that but I am not the type to have a strong opinion before I know what is going on and have heard a bunch of opinions about it. And although I've been <em>around</em> ownCloud a fair bit, having written and talked about it, used it and knowing many of you, I intend to take my time to get to know you all better. Of course, marketing is my thing, so I'm sure to be around in that area, helping spread the word on what ownCloud is doing and why it matters.<br><br>Opinions, ideas and introductions are very welcome! I'm around on most social media but most actively on G+ and of course you can email me, ping me <a href="irc://#owncloud-dev@freenode.net">IRC</a> and so on.<br><br>I really look forward to getting my head in the clouds with you all!<br></div>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend Daniel, Arthur, Morris and me were in Chemnitz where the <a href="http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2014/de/info/">Chemnitzer Linuxtage 2014</a> took place. We drove a booth during the two days, the CLT host around 60 boothes of companies and FOSS projects. I like to go to the CLT because it is perfectly organized with great enthusiasm of everybody involved from the organisation team. Food, schedules, the venue, everything is perfect. </p>
<p>Even on saturday morning, short after opening of the event, somebody from the orga team was showing up on the booth with chocolate for the volunteers, saying hello and asking if everything is in place for a successful weekend. A small detail, which shows how much effort is put into organization of the event.</p>
<p>As a result, visitors come to visit the event. It&rsquo;s mostly a community centric event: Exhibitors are mostly representing FOSS projects such as <a href="http://dragotin.wordpress.com/openstreetmap.org">openstreetmap.org</a>, distributions like <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> or <a href="http://opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a> or companies from the free software market. </p><div><a href="http://dragotin.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/clt14_morris.jpg"><img src="http://dragotin.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/clt14_morris.jpg?w=595&amp;h=415" alt="Morris in action on the booth" width="595" height="415"></a><p>Morris in action on the booth</p></div>The majority of visitors are mostly interested in private use of the software. But, no rule without exception, we also had a remarkable number of people from companies, either executives or people working in the IT departments, who were interested in ownCloud.
<p>Speaking about <a href="http://owncloud.org/">ownCloud</a>, I want to say that it&rsquo;s amazing to represent our project. People know it, people like it, people use it. In private, but also in professional space people work with ownCloud already or are planing to start with ownCloud. ownCloud already is <i>the</i> accepted solution for the problems that became so practical with the NSA scandal last year.</p>
<p>My talk with title <i><a href="http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2014/de/vortraege/detail/279">A private Cloud with ownCloud</a></i> on Saturday morning was very well received and went smooth. The room was too small, lots of people had to stand or sit on the stairs. It was a very positive atmosphere. </p>
<p>Something that changed compared to last year and the year before: Most discussions were around how ownCloud can be installed, integrated and used and not any more about which features are still missing or maybe also bugs.</p>
<p>So it were two very exhausting days, but big fun! Thanks to Daniel, Arthur and Morris for the work and fun we had on the booth, and thanks to the CLT team for CLT.</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/dragotin.wordpress.com/426/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/dragotin.wordpress.com/426/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=dragotin.wordpress.com&amp;blog=31325229&amp;post=426&amp;subd=dragotin&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1">]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<div>Today we are happy to announce the release of the ownCloud mobile libraries for iOS and Android. ownCloud is a free file sync and share solution. The main differentiator to Dropbox, Google Drive, and others beside being free software is that you can run it yourself wherever you want. Obviously a central place to you store your files is only useful if you can access it from all devices and integrate it with all of the applications that you use.</div><div><br></div><div>Because of that, the ownCloud strategy is to provide as many ways as possible to access files and data stored in ownCloud. We have a strong commitment to support open protocols and formats like WebDAV, CalDAV, CardDAV, OCS, ODF and others. So you can mount your ownCloud via WebDAV easily with KDE, GNOME, Windows, Mac and so on. It's easy to integrate ownCloud with other systems by transferring files via WebDAV. This is the power of open protocols. But ownCloud provides much more than that. There are mobile applications for iOS and Android and Desktop syncing</div><div>clients that you can use to work with you files. The Desktop syncing clients runs on Mac, Windows and Linux and also ship with a command line client that can be used to automatically sync folders between desktops and the server or script it in any way. There is also a C++ library that can be used by 3rdparty clients like the KDE Plasma one. So there are a lot of options to access your ownCloud from the desktop.</div><div><br></div><div>On the phone and tablet side it was, until now, a bit more difficult. A user could use the official ownCloud apps, but if a 3rd party app wanted to access an ownCloud server, then the 3rd party app had to implement all of the WebDAV and REST calls needed to talk to ownCloud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is why today we released free libraries for iOS and Android that can be used used by mobile developers to add ownCloud support to their apps. They provide easy to use methods to read and write files, share files and many more useful operations. To make these libraries as useful as possible to as many developers as possible, we have released them under the MIT license.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The libraries can be download here&nbsp;</div><div><span><a href="https://github.com/owncloud/ios-library">https://github.com/owncloud/ios-library</a></span></div><div><span><a href="https://github.com/owncloud/android-library">https://github.com/owncloud/android-library</a></span></div><div><br></div><div>The documentation how to use them can be found here:</div><div><a href="http://doc.owncloud.org/server/6.0/developer_manual/ios_library/index.html">http://doc.owncloud.org/server/6.0/developer_manual/ios_library/index.html</a></div><div><a href="http://doc.owncloud.org/server/6.0/developer_manual/android_library/index.html">http://doc.owncloud.org/server/6.0/developer_manual/android_library/index.html</a></div><div><br></div><div>For any developer related questions please post to the new ownCloud developer list <a href="http://mailman.owncloud.org/mailman/listinfo/devel"><span>http://mailman.owncloud.org/mailman/listinfo/devel</span></a></div><div><br></div><br><div><br></div>]]></description>

<p>Back in 2005 I started to use Linux and because I had no clue I looked for support in the <a href="http://www.kubuntu-de.org/">German-language Kubuntu community</a>. This is how I jumped into and got an idea about Free Software. Kubuntu and the people were fun, after some time I was able to give support and not only take it. I helped out with other things, started to attend conferences (usually also in combination with a Kubuntu community booth). I met amazing people who became really really good friends.</p>
<p>An outstanding position does have the <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag</a> in Berlin, because there I made my most important contacts. It was the first time, I met my friends from the German-language Kubuntu community in person. It was the place, where I first met <a href="http://blog.karlitschek.de/">Frank</a>, founder of <a href="http://owncloud.org/">ownCloud</a>. The later founded company behind the ownCloud project now gives me the chance to make a living with free software. I cannot deny it was a dream.</p>
<p>Most important however was that at the same conference I met my beloved wife. Yes, personally the I Love FS day has more in common with the Valentine's day than you might guess. </p>
<p>Needless to say that LinuxTag was also the first conference, my son attended &ndash; at the age of 9 months ;)</p>
<p>Happy <a href="http://ilovefs.org/">I Love FS day</a>!</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><div></div><a href="http://owncloud.org/" target="_blank">ownCloud</a> helps us to access our files from anywhere in the world, without take the control of data from us. Traditionally server's local hard disks have been used to act as storage backend but these days, as the latency of networks is decreasing, storing data over network is becoming cheaper and safer (in terms of recovery). ownCloud is capable of using SFTP, WebDAV, SMB, OpenStack Swift and several other storage mechanisms. We'll see the usage of <a href="http://swift.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack Swift</a> with ownCloud in this tutorial<br><br>At this point, the assumption is that we already have admin access to an ownCloud instance and we have set up OpenStack Swift somewhere. If not, to setup OpenStack Swift, follow <a href="http://blog.adityapatawari.com/2014/01/openstack-101-how-to-setup-openstack_12.html" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>.<br><br><b>Step 1:</b> External storage facilities are provided by an app known as "External storage support", written by Robin Appelman and Michael Gapczynski, which ships with ownCloud and is available on the apps dashboard. It is disabled by default, we need to enable it.<br><br><b>Step 2:</b> We need to go to Admin page of the ownCloud installation and locate "External Storage" configuration area. We'll select "OpenStack Swift" from the drop down menu.<br><br><b>Step 3:</b> We need to fill in the details and credentials. We'll need the following information:<br><ul><li>Folder Name: A user friendly name for the storage mount point.</li><li>user: Username of the Swift user (required)</li><li>bucket : Bucket can be any random string (required). It is a container where all the files will be kept.</li><li>region: Region (optional for OpenStack Object Storage).</li><li>key: API Key (required for Rackspace Cloud Files). This is not required for OpenStack Swift. Leave it empty.</li><li>tenant: Tenant name (required for OpenStack Object Storage). Tenant name would be the same tenant of which the Swift user is a part of. It is created using OpenStack Keystone.</li><li>password: Password of the Swift user (required for OpenStack Object Storage)</li><li>service_name: Service Name (required for OpenStack Object Storage). This is the same name which was used while creating the Swift service</li><li>url: URL of identity endpoint (required for OpenStack Object Storage). It is the Keystone endpoint against which authorization will be done.</li><li>timeout: Timeout of HTTP requests in seconds (optional)</li></ul><br>Just to get a better hold on things, check out the image of an <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FPgT77_GObk/UtqpK1sA9wI/AAAAAAAAAQc/Pj1HtFtLiSo/s1600/ownCloud_OpenStack_Swift1.png" target="_blank">empty configuration</a> form and here is a <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-54DbxoPWtFU/Utq8-p4hTII/AAAAAAAAAQs/eOLNy5yG-m4/s1600/ownCloud_OpenStack_Swift2.png" target="_blank">filled up</a> one.<br><br>Notice that if ownCloud is successfully able to connect and authorize then a green circle appear on the left side of the configuration. In case things don't work out as expected then check out the owncloud.log in the data directory of ownCloud instance.<br><br>That is it. Now ownCloud is now ready to use OpenStack Swift to store data.</div>]]></description>

   <description><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><div><h3><b>Presenting a ready-to-install image of ownCloud for Raspberry Pi&nbsp;</b></h3><b>A small introduction to ownCloud</b></div><span><a href="http://owncloud.org/" target="_blank">ownCloud</a> is an application which enables users to share their data without giving control to any third party posing as a facilitator. While sharing the data without loosing control is the main objective, ownCloud is much more than that. It can also rapidly sync the data, contacts, calendar events etc from several devices. It can work with several custom backends and it is highly flexible.</span><br><div><br></div><div>Many of us have a Raspberry Pi with us and we love playing with it. In past I have written posts on <a href="http://blog.adityapatawari.com/2013/05/arch-linux-on-raspberry-pi-running-xfce.html">how to install Arch Linux on it</a> and <a href="http://blog.adityapatawari.com/2013/07/converting-raspberry-pi-into-media.html">how to install OpenELEC to convert the Raspberry Pi into a Media Centre</a>. This time I plan to go a little further. This time I have made a custom image which comes preinstalled with ownCloud and some tweaks to improve the ownCloud experience with Raspberry Pi. This image is based on Raspbian Wheezy.<br><br></div></div>Just follow the steps below and you'll be good to go in no time:<br><ol><li>Download the archived image from in either <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/owncloud-raspberrypi/files/owncloud-raspberrypi-0.2.img.zip/download" target="_blank">zip format</a> (usually for Windows) or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/owncloud-raspberrypi/files/owncloud-raspberrypi-0.2.img.gz/download" target="_blank">gunzip format</a> (usually for Linux and Unix like platforms)<br>Since I am running on Linux, I would download gunzip format.</li><li>Extract it and put it on a SD card using dd or any other tool or command. Check out this article on <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup" target="_blank">elinux</a> if you need any help for this. Although 2 GB SD card would be fine but I would recommend using 4 GB or more.<br>I would run the following commands:<br><code>$ gunzip owncloud-raspberrypi-0.1.img.gz  # to extract the gz archive<br>$ sudo dd bs=1M if=owncloud-raspberrypi-0.1.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 # to write to the SD card. /dev/mmcblk0 can be obtained by the output of df command.</code></li><li>Put this SD card in your Raspberry Pi and boot. The default credentials are:<br>user: pi<br>password: owncloud</li><li>Run raspi-config and follow the directions to expand the filesystem to enjoy maximum disk space. Reboot, if required.</li><li>Run ifconfig to get the ip address of the Raspberry Pi.</li></ol><br>That is it. Just open http://&lt;ip_address&gt;/<ip_address>owncloud and create the admin user and explore ownCloud on Raspberry Pi.</ip_address></div><br>This image PHP execution time increased to 60 seconds and the upload limit has been bumped up to 500M. The Apache is set to allow .htaccess for the protection of data directory. Also SSH has been enabled by default.<br><br>The official page for the image can be found at <a href="http://www.owncloudbook.com/owncloud-on-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank">ownCloud on Raspberry Pi</a>. A Hacker News discussion is also going on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6268271" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>If you like this image and you are interested in knowing more about ownCloud, then please consider buying my book, <a href="http://www.owncloudbook.com/" target="_blank">Getting Started with ownCloud</a>.

   <title>On Practical Qt Security</title>
   <link>https://daniel.molkentin.net/2014/01/04/on-practical-qt-security/</link>

   <comments>https://daniel.molkentin.net/2014/01/04/on-practical-qt-security/</comments>
   <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2014 23:43:00 +0000</pubDate>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="https://daniel.molkentin.net/">30C3</a>, Ilja van Sprundel gave a <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/30C3_-_5499_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312291830_-_x_security_-_ilja_van_sprundel.html">talk on X Security</a>. In this talk, he also discussed Qt security matters, specifically how running a <code>setuid</code> binary which links against Qt is unsafe due to exploitable bugs in the Qt code base (citing the infamous <code>setuid</code> practice in KPPP). While his points are valid, he misses the greater picture: <strong>Qt was not designed for use in <code>setuid</code> applications!</strong> Consequently there are a lot of ways the security of a Qt application can be compromised when it runs as root. So I went on to discuss this issue with QtNetwork maintainer Richard Moore, and we both agree that in contrary to Iljas claim, we <strong>do</strong> need to dictate policy. So here it goes:</p>
<p><strong>Do not ship Qt applications that require setuid.</strong> While the same <em>is probably true for any other toolkit</em>, we have only discussed this for Qt in more depth. Actually, Rich has <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/#change,74531">prepared a patch</a> for Qt 5.3 that will quit if you try to run an application <code>setuid</code> unless you ask it to. This should make it harder to shoot yourself into the foot.</p>
<p>While making <code>QtCore</code> and <code>QtNetwork</code> safe for <code>setuid</code> use is possible, they currently are not. If you absolutely have to (and you really shouldn&rsquo;t), at least unset <code>QT_PLUGIN_PATH</code> and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> in <code>main()</code>. The latter is required because even though <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> is ignored by the linker for <code>setuid</code> binaries, it is used internally by <code>QtNetwork</code> unconditionally to look for OpenSSL. Of course, you also need to follow all the other <a href="http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/networking/puis/ch23_04.htm">best practices</a> (note that even this list is incomplete, e.g. it doesn&rsquo;t mention to close FDs). </p>
<p>However, there are also situations where a Qt application running as user can be unsafe, so to those who ship their own Qt build to their customers, there are even more policies:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Never build Qt so its prefix is a publicly writable directory</strong>, such as <code>/tmp</code>: Suppose you build a in-source (developer) build in <code>/tmp/qt</code>, then Qt will go ahead and look for plugins in <code>/tmp/qt/plugins</code>. A malicious user could simply provide a fake style there that next to calling the style which the user would expect (e.g. via <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtwidgets/qproxystyle.html">QProxyStyle</a>) executes arbitrary malicious code. The same goes for Image IO plugins, which are handled in <code>QtCore</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Never build  Qt so its prefix is a home directory:</strong> This one is more tricky and a lot harder/unlikely to exploit, but it&rsquo;s a valid attack vector nonetheless: Suppose Joe Coder compiles Qt in-source on <code>/home/joe/dev/qt</code>. Now every customer needs to make sure that a local user by the same name is a really nice person.</li>
</ul><p>So in conclusion, a better summary of the above would be:</p>
<blockquote><p>Never distribute binaries built with a prefix that is a non-system directory!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you already have this setup, but need a hotfix, there is hope: libQtCore.so contains strings starting in <code>qt_plugpath=</code> and <code>qt_libspath=</code>. Both are padded to 1024 bytes. Adding a binary null after the first <code>/</code> keeps Qt from looking for loadable code in user accessible locations.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The bugs Ilja points out are valid, but only affect applications that don&rsquo;t follow good practice. We will attempt to make it harder for developers to make these mistakes, but writing suid applications isn&rsquo;t something that will ever be recommended, or easy to do safely. Apart from the suid issue however, there are more traps lingering if you provide your own Qt and build it in an unsafe way.</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<div><a href="http://www.schiessle.org/pics/blog/ownCloudShareLinkCreator/context_menu.png"><img alt="ownCloud Share Link Creator - Context Menu" src="http://www.schiessle.org/pics/blog/ownCloudShareLinkCreator/context_menu.png" width="300"></a><p>ownCloud Share Link Creator &ndash; Context Menu</p></div>
<p>Holiday season is the perfect time to work on some stuff on your personal ToDo list. ownCloud 6 introduced a public REST-style <a href="http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/developer_manual/core/ocs-share-api.html">Share-API</a> which allows you to call various share operations from external applications. Since I started working on the Share-API I thought about having a simple shell script on my file manager to automatically upload a file and generate a public link for it&hellip; <a href="https://github.com/schiesbn/shareLinkCreator">Here it is!</a></p>
<p>I wrote a script which can be integrated in the Thunar file manager as a &ldquo;custom action&rdquo;. It is possible that the program also works with other file managers which provide similar possibilities, e.g Nautilus. But until now I tested and used it with Thunar only. If you try the script with a different file manager I would be happy to hear about your experience.</p>
<div><a href="http://www.schiessle.org/pics/blog/ownCloudShareLinkCreator/upload.png"><img alt="ownCloud Share Link Creator - File Upload" src="http://www.schiessle.org/pics/blog/ownCloudShareLinkCreator/upload.png" width="300"></a><p>ownCloud Share Link Creator &ndash; File Upload</p></div>
<p>If you configure the &ldquo;custom action&rdquo; in Thunar, make sure to pass the paths of all selected files to the program using the &ldquo;%F&rdquo; parameter. The program expects the absolute path to the files. In the &ldquo;Appearance and Conditions&rdquo; tab you can activate all file types and directories. Once the custom action is configured you can execute the program from the right-click context menu. The program works for all file types and also for directories. Once the script gets executed it will first upload the files/directories to your ownCloud and afterwards it will generate a public link to access them. The link will be copied directly to your clipboard, additionally a dialog will inform you about the URL. If you uploaded a single file or directory than the file/directory will be created directly below your default target folder as defined in the shell script. If you selected multiple files, than the program will group them together in a directory named with the current timestamp.</p>
<p>This program does already almost everything I want. As already said, it can upload multiple files and even directories. One think I want to add in the future is the possibility to detect a ownCloud sync folder on the desktop. If the user selects a file in the sync folder than the script should skip the upload and create the share link directly.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In the meantime I got feedback that the script also works nicely with Dolphin, Nautilus and Nemo</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>While it is nice that <a title="OwnCloud 6 mit sozialen Funktionen" href="http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/OwnCloud-6-mit-sozialen-Funktionen-2064208.html">Heise</a> and even <a title="Private Cloud-Speicher: Wege zur sicheren Datenwolke" href="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/cloud-computing-wege-zum-sicheren-online-speicher-a-938957.html">Spiegel Online</a> (not to mention <a title="ownCloud in the news" href="https://owncloud.com/blog/category/owncloud-in-the-news">great publications in the US as well</a>) are writing positively about <a title="ownCloud Community" href="https://owncloud.org/">ownCloud</a>, I have yet to see an article that captures my personal motivation for working on it. Most articles mention the NSA and how great it is to reclaim the control over your data.That certainly is true. But while ownCloud Inc. is concentrating on file synchronization and <a title="So, you think you have a Dropbox problem" href="https://owncloud.com/owncloud-overview#so-you-think-you-have-a-dropbox-problem">solving the Dropbox problem</a>, I think the ownCloud community has set out to do a lot more.</p>
<h2>Independence</h2>
<p>Looking at <a title="owncloud apps repository on github" href="https://github.com/owncloud/apps">the apps repository</a> you can easily recognize one google app replacement after another: <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/calendar">calendar</a>, <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/contacts">contacts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/mail">mail</a>, <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/maps">maps</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/owncloud/news">news</a>, <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/music">music</a>, <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/apps/tree/master/gallery">pictures</a> &hellip; even <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/documents">documents</a>. Or <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/android">the Android app</a>. So much for the googleverse.&nbsp;All in all that is a solid foundation on which to get self-hosting again. My main motivation.</p>
<h2>Opportunity</h2>
<p>Replacing the googleverse is far from easy. And I certainly am aware of their search capabilities. I already started working on <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/apps/tree/master/search_lucene">a lucene-based full text search</a> of the users files and we will be redesigning ownCloud search for OC7. Maybe at some point in the future someone will start integrating <a title="Decentralized Web Search" href="http://yacy.net/">yacy</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft started integrating their outlook.com accounts with their operating system and allows users to login with an online account. With <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/ThreePointSeven/Features/Owncloud">Gnome</a> and <a href="http://dot.kde.org/2013/09/05/plasma-active-4-ready-when-you-are">KDE</a> the two big linux Desktop environments also have started integrating ownCloud. Not only as a contacts or calendar backend but also as a music source for Rythmbox / Amarok. That&rsquo;s only the start&hellip;</p>
<p>The nice thing is that ownCloud faces so many challenges, so many opportunities to experiment with the next technology stack, over-hyped framework or whatnot that I&rsquo;ll never run out of ideas to try out next. Another huge motivation for me: it keeps my mind busy.</p>
<h2>Choice</h2>
<p>All the related projects and technologies bring me to another motivation: choice. Should I get bored customizing ownCloud, I can always shift my focus to working on a specific app. That already happened and I meanwhile worked on the gallery, search_lucene, music and the files app among other. Should I ever get bored writing PHP I can always go back to Java and work&nbsp;on the Android app, learn Objective-C with the&nbsp;iOS app or maybe C# with the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/owncloud/windows-phone">Windows Phone</a>&nbsp;app. I might even shift my attention to the <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/mirall">Mirall desktop client</a> which is C++ and Qt. Anything is possible.</p>
<h2>The right thing</h2>
<p>Faced with data silos like Google, Facebook and Dropbox I fear the power these services could assert over any of their users. I don&rsquo;t care if their motto is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be evil&rdquo; or whatever nice claim they might come up with. The fact is that humans work there and that other humans have access to my personal data. And humans can do very irrational things.</p>
<p>While <a title="Dear Sophie" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vkVHijdQk">the commercial</a> where a father manages a google account for his child until it grows up as some kind of lifelog is touching &hellip; it is also frightening. Very frightening. Your whole life digitized. Searchable. Machine readable. A double edged sword if you ask me.</p>
<p>Who would you want to hold it? Someone who earns money by giving away your very personal information? I know <a title="user data manifesto - defining basic rights for people to control their own data in the internet age" href="http://userdatamanifesto.org/">the answer</a> to that. And I will do anything I can to allow future generations to wield their own sword.</p>
<h2>Join the community</h2>
<p>I already became medieval so let me rephrase the above: &ldquo;Brace yourself! Winter is coming.&rdquo; I laid out my personal motivation. Maybe one of them resonates well with your own.&nbsp;Help us shape the future and <a href="https://owncloud.org/">join the ownCloud community</a>. Start by <a href="http://owncloud.org/install/">installing ownCloud now</a>!</p>

   <description><![CDATA[<div>I'm supper happy to announce the release of ownCloud 6 today.</div><div>ownCloud 6 is a special release in several way. The community did an incredible job with improving ownCloud in several important areas.</div><div></div><ul><li>Quality. ownCloud is a very fast moving project so it is super important to balance innovative new features with rock solid stability. The ownCloud community introduced several important techniques to improve the quality. As a result we fixed a huge amount of bugs in this release. Also some very old and annoying issues are finally gone. I think this is very important for a lot of users. We will release a series of bugfix releases for in the next few month to iron out the last remaining issues. This is a big step forward.</li></ul><div></div><ul><li>Performance. The performance of ownCloud 6 improved significantly over older versions. The overall file-handling is faster and more optimized. In some areas, like the mounting of SFTP, CIFS or Dropbox servers, the performance improved over 10x. This is great for people who run their ownCloud server on a small device like a Raspberry Pi or on a big cluster to serve hundred thousands of users.</li></ul><div></div><ul><li>Innovation It was always to goal of ownCloud to deliver innovative features to our users and to be the innovation leader in our space. I don't want to repeat my previous blog posts where I announced the great new features of version 6. Just look at my posts here. &nbsp;<a href="http://blog.karlitschek.de/2013/10/introducing-owncloud-6.html">http://blog.karlitschek.de/2013/10/introducing-owncloud-6.html</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.karlitschek.de/2013/10/welcome-owncloud-documents.html">http://blog.karlitschek.de/2013/10/welcome-owncloud-documents.html</a><u>&nbsp;</u></li><li>But I have to say that I'm especially proud about what we did with ownCloud Documents. This is a feature that doesn't exist anywhere else. Other collaborative editing solutions are 1.) proprietary or 2.) don't run on your own hardware or 3.) don't work on top of normal files that you can also sync and share or 4.) a combination of all of this. I belief that this features is super important for the future and the huge response we got from users clearly show that I'm not alone here. This is only the first version of this feature of course. We will keep on improving and polishing it in the future.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Please look at <a href="http://owncloud.org/six"><span>http://owncloud.org/six</span></a> for more information about ownCloud 6.</div><div><br></div><div>ownCloud is more important now then every if you follow the latest surveillance and espionage revelations. A free and self hosted alternative to the big proprietary cloud services is essential for the future.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks to the awesome ownCloud community who builds all this. Thanks a lot to everyone who contributed to this great release. And thanks to ownCloud Inc. who sponsors the development of free software.</div><div><br></div><div>ownCloud is built by a great community with a completely open development process. Everyone is welcome to join us and help to build software which can protect all of us from surveillance. Please join us at <a href="https://owncloud.org/"><span>https://owncloud.org</span></a> if you want to make the world a little bit better.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br><div>Frank</div>]]></description>

   <title>Building the ownCloud client for Windows on openSUSE 12.3 using a vagrant box</title>

   <pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2013 10:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>You want to build the ownCloud client yourself for Windows?</p>
<p>Well it is pretty good explained already in the official docs: <a href="http://doc.owncloud.org/desktop/1.4/building.html" rel="nofollow">http://doc.owncloud.org/desktop/1.4/building.html</a></p>
<p>But what to do if you don&rsquo;t use openSUSE?</p>
<p>Fire it up in <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">vagrant</a>!</p>
<pre> $ mkdir {folder where the vagrant configuration will live AND the mirall and ocsync sources}
 $ vagrant box add openSUSE_12.3 http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensusevagrant/files/12.3/opensuse-12.3-64.box/download
 $ vagrant init openSUSE_12.3
 $ vagrant up
</pre>
<p>Once nice feature about vagrant is that this folder will be available with the openSUSE box under /vagrant .<br>
Cloning the csync and miral code into this folder and also keep the build folders in here will allow file manipulation on the local system &ndash; e.g. use QtCreator.<br>
Only for building the win32 you ssh into the vagrant box.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first get the sources:</p>
<pre>
$ git clone -b ocsync git://git.csync.org/users/freitag/csync.git ocsync
$ git clone git://github.com/owncloud/mirall.git
$ mkdir mirall-build-win32
$ mkdir ocsync-build-win32
</pre>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at them in the vagrant box:</p>
<pre>
$ vagrant ssh
# now we are in the openSUSE box
$ ls /vagrant
mirall  mirall-build-win32  ocsync  ocsync-build-win32
</pre>
<p>Let&rsquo;s prepare the box with all necessary tools and packages required to build mirall and ocsync:</p>
<pre># take the wheel
$ sudo su -

# update the system - always a good idea
$ zypper update

# setup mingw repositories
$ zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/windows:/mingw:/win32/openSUSE_12.3/windows:mingw:win32.repo
$ zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/windows:/mingw/openSUSE_12.3/windows:mingw.repo

# install required packages
$ zypper install cmake make mingw32-cross-binutils mingw32-cross-cpp mingw32-cross-gcc \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mingw32-cross-gcc-c++ mingw32-cross-pkg-config mingw32-filesystem \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mingw32-headers mingw32-runtime site-config mingw32-libqt4-sql \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mingw32-libqt4-sql-sqlite mingw32-libsqlite-devel \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mingw32-dlfcn-devel mingw32-libssh2-devel kdewin-png2ico \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mingw32-libqt4 mingw32-libqt4-devel mingw32-libgcrypt \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mingw32-libgnutls mingw32-libneon-openssl mingw32-libneon-devel \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mingw32-libbeecrypt mingw32-libopenssl mingw32-openssl \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mingw32-libpng-devel mingw32-libsqlite mingw32-qtkeychain \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mingw32-qtkeychain-devel mingw32-dlfcn mingw32-libintl-devel \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mingw32-libneon-devel mingw32-libopenssl-devel mingw32-libproxy-devel \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mingw32-libxml2-devel mingw32-zlib-devel

# install Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)
$ zypper install mingw32-cross-nsis

# and NSIS plugins required
rpm -ihv http://download.tomahawk-player.org/packman/mingw:32/openSUSE_12.1/x86_64/mingw32-cross-nsis-plugin-processes-0-1.1.x86_64.rpm
rpm -ihv http://download.tomahawk-player.org/packman/mingw:32/openSUSE_12.1/x86_64/mingw32-cross-nsis-plugin-uac-0-3.1.x86_64.rpm
</pre>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build ocsync:</p>
<pre>
$ cd /vagrant/ocsync-build-win32
$ mingw32-cmake ../ocsync
$ make
</pre>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build mirall</p>
<pre>
$ cd /vagrant/mirall-build-win32
$ cmake ../mirall \
      -DCSYNC_BUILD_PATH=/vagrant/ocsync-build-win32 \
      -DCSYNC_INCLUDE_PATH=/vagrant/ocsync/src \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../mirall/admin/win/Toolchain-mingw32-openSUSE.cmake
$ make
$ make package
</pre>
<p>And we are done! The windows installer is available under /vagrant/dev/mirall-build-win32/ .<br>
But the installer is also available within your local file system!</p>
<p>As I use a VirtualBox for Windows testing I that mirall-build-win32 folder is a shared folder on the Windows box as well &ndash; the installer can be tested right away!</p>
<p>Take care!</p><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/deepdiver1975.wordpress.com/36/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/deepdiver1975.wordpress.com/36/"></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=deepdiver1975.wordpress.com&amp;blog=41236390&amp;post=36&amp;subd=deepdiver1975&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" height="1">]]></description>
